title: Deep Active Learning for Detection of Bow Shock and Magnetopause crossings around Mercury
abstract: In this work, we develop classification techniques to detect bow shock and magnetopause signatures in magnetic data from Messenger. chorus wave signatures in the magnetic signal. Additionally, we experiment with various Active Learning techniques to select the most informative data orbits to minimise data annotation load.
